Todd Mahaffey is a Seattle native, specifically from Lake Forest Park. He attended the Shoreline Public Schools, where he began playing the trumpet in 5th Grade Band. He continued through high school, playing in the school Band, Jazz Band and the Cascade Youth Symphony.

Todd then attended the University of Washington, where he performed in the Marching Band, Jazz Band, Wind Ensemble and Orchestra. During his school years, he took provate trumpet lessons first with Brad Allison and then with Roy Cummings. Todd graduated from U.W. in 1996 with a degree in Music Education. He began teaching Band in the Issaquah School District, where he remained for four years. In 2001, he moved the Bellevue School District, where he continues to work, teaching Band at Chinook Middle School (6th-8th Grade). He also serves as a conductor for the Cascade Youth Symphony Orchestra program, conducting the Junior Symphony.

In the past 10 years, Todd has performed with many local ensembles, including Tacoma Symphony, Northwest Mahler Festival Orchestra, Northwest Symphony, Orchestra Seattle, Seattle Philharmonic, Greenwood Concert Band, MOJO Big Band and many others. He currently plays regularly with the Lake Union Civic Orchestra and Cambalache Salsa.


Janet Young is a native of Seaford, Sussex in the UK, but has lived in Seattle since 1998. Her musical life began on the violin at age 5, although five years later she saw the light and began playing cornet in the local brass band, finding the instrument a much more natural fit than the violin. Janet no longer plays the violin but admits to the occasional bout of string envy when the topic of chamber music arises. She soon acquired a trumpet in addition to the cornet (the two instruments are very similar), studying with Sussex teachers David Batstone and Malcolm Warnes.

Janetâ€™s undergraduate studies were at Clare College at the University of Cambridge where the rich student musical life provided endless opportunities to play with talented musicians. Her degree in Natural Sciences was followed by a doctorate in Genetics from University College, London. She is now a research scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center by day, but remains a keen musician. Janet is a member of Orchestra Seattle and the Lake Union Civic Orchestra, as well as a frequent guest with numerous other local ensembles. Recently, Janet has very much enjoyed her first trumpet lessons since her college days with David Gordon of the Seattle Symphony.
