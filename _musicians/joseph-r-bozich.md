An award-winning saxophonist, composer, and conductor, Joseph R. Bozich is currently finishing up his final year of studies in Music Education at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington. As a saxophonist, he has twice been a national finalist in the MTNA National Young Artist Woodwind Competition and won the 2010 Beatrice Herrmann Young Artist Solo Competition, and as part of the Puget Sound Saxophone Quartet took third place at the 2012 MTNA National Chamber Music Competition and won the 2012 Ladies Musical Club of Seattle Ensemble Competition. As part of that prize, the group was featured in September 2012 on Classical KING-FM's Northwest Focus. As a composer, he attended Brevard Music Center in 2012, and has had numerous compositions premiered by the University of Puget Sound Wind Ensemble, Jazz Band, and Saxophone Ensemble, as well as by faculty and recital ensembles.

As a conductor, he has appeared with multiple ad hoc ensembles and currently serves as the Assistant Conductor with the Lake Union Civic Orchestra. He currently studies saxophone with Fred Winkler, composition with Dr. Robert Hutchinson, and conducting with Gerard Morris (all on faculty at the University of Puget Sound), as well as taking conducting from Christophe Chagnard, music director of the Northwest Sinfonietta and Lake Union Civic Orchestra. This coming Fall he will be attending the University of Michigan to begin studying a Masters of Music in Orchestral Conducting with Kenneth Kiesler.
