André van Haren is a 44 year old classical musician from The Netherlands currently living in Sweden. Because of his daily job, he only has a couple of hours a day to compose. “I use these hours very efficient,” Andre says, “and decide already the evening before what I’m going to work on the next day.” The forethought shows in his excellent compositions.

André is equally at home with Romantic and Classic eras, as well as Twentieth Century/contemporary classical. He writes effortlessly in both complex and simple styles. His work is inventive, passionate, highly skilled, sophisticated, yet always full of humanity and heart.

After six years of piano lessons at the music school in Zevenaar and later with Liliane Lepiet in Velp, André moved to the conservatory in Utrecht to get his teacher degree, so he could teach classical piano. After five years of intense piano playing and lessons at this school with Robert Groslot, he took his final exam on September 10, 1990, and started seriously to compose. He took lessons from Henk Alkema who teaches composition at the same institute and took his final exam in composition on March 3, 1995. After graduation, he dedicated all his time to compose, writing mostly for voice. His musical style is very tonal.

On the 11th of April 2003, André moved to Gothenburg, Sweden, where on May 9th he married Angie Rodriguez who teaches English and Spanish and works as a School-Assistant at a college in Lindholmen.
