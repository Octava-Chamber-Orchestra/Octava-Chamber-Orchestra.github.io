Lesley Petty grew up in a musical family in which all five kids played instruments, living in a very small house with a very large piano. She first fell in love with the bassoon in high school and continued playing into her 20â€™s, at which point she put the instrument aside to pursue a career in textiles running her own business.

Eventually Lesley found that she missed playing music, and returned to the bassoon after finding an instrument in a second-hand shop in Friday Harbor, Washington. She studied primarily with Paul Rafanelli, also studying with Alan Futterman and Franck Leblois, and has been an active and busy part of the Seattle music community since 1994.

She is currently principal bassoon in the Lake Union Civic Orchestra (LUCO) and Octava, and has also played with the Yakima and Walla Walla Symphonies, Orchestra Seattle, the Bremerton Symphony, Philharmonia Northwest and Seattle Philharmonic.
