Al Berg retired last year as professor of family medicine at the University of Washington, allowing him to indulge a passion for music making, especially with small chamber ensembles. He has studied piano, organ, and harpsichord with many local coaches, including with organists Winston Johnson and Peter Hallock. Al has been on the Board of Trustees for the Seattle Chamber Music Society, and is now on the Board of the Lake Union Civic Orchestra. Al and his wife Janet (who sings in the Seattle Bach Choir) host regular music events at their home.
