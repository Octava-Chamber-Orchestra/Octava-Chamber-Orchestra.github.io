Composer, Jeffrey Moidel, is also a pianist, voice teacher and vocal coach. He has composed for various genres including voice, piano, chamber music, dance, and musical theater— and he’s very excited to present his first compositions for orchestra in today’s concert with Octava!

Excerpts from his song cycle, Sacraments of Desire, were used at the 8th International Unity and Diversity Conference to illustrate a lecture on the treatment of dissonance and harmony in music and society. Mr. Moidel premiered and performed the full song cycle with soprano Regina Thomas at the Seattle Art Museum in 2006, under the auspices of the Ladies Musical Club.

His piano pieces have been choreographed and performed by the Paul Taylor Dance Company with the composer at the piano in concerts at City Center in New York. Other dance compositions include Aspen Fantasy for flute and piano, and The Song of Larkspur Mountain for piano and narrator, both commissioned and performed by the Aspen Dance Connection.

Mr. Moidel received commissions to write several children’s musicals for the Aspen Community School, including The Time Machine,The Little Lame Prince, Little Lord Fauntleroy, The Princess and the Goblin, Another Way, Chorus Kids, and Kittens. Also in Aspen, he was the composer and musical director for the opening ceremonies of the 1990 International Design Conference, and he was commissioned to write a commemorative production number celebrating the Aspen Skiing Company’s 40th anniversary and dedication of the new gondola on Aspen Mountain.

Locally, the Seattle Children’s Theater has performed numerous excerpts from Mr. Moidel’s musicals. His original compositions and arrangements have also been performed by the Seattle Men’s Chorus with Mr. Moidel at the piano. Echo’s Song—a piece for flute, piano and narrator, originally commissioned by Aspen Stage for radio broadcasts— received its first public performances in Seattle at the Nippon Kan Theater and Hokum Hall. The composer received an Artist Assist Grant from Jack Straw Studios in 2001, and a grant from 4Culture in 2013 to assist him with the orchestrations of the Love Sonnets.

In his other musical capacities, Mr. Moidel has performed as a piano soloist and collaborative pianist throughout the United States, Europe and South America, working with such artists as Vinson Cole, Gene Boucher, Neil Rosenshein, Jan DeGaetani, Irene Gubrud, Eva de la O, Elisabeth Mannion, and has also performed and recorded with popular artists including Ann Hampton Calloway and John Denver. He once gave a private concert at Gracie Mansion in New York City for Mayor Koch and his guests.

Mr. Moidel has been a vocal coach and instructor for Seattle Opera’s Young Artist Program, the Aspen Music Festival, the Vocal Institute at the University of California at Santa Barbara, the Peter Harrower Opera Program at Georgia State University, the Perry Mansfield School for the Performing Arts in Colorado, the Marrowstone Music Festival in Bellingham, and he was an Assistant Professor at Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle. In addition, he has served as the Assistant Music Director and Chorus Master for Tacoma Opera and Skagit Opera and has been chair of the music department at the Washington Academy for the Performing Arts. Mr. Moidel is a graduate of the Mannes College of Music in New York City.
