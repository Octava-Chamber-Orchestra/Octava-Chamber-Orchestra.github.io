Chris Worswick has been playing violoncello and piano from age 9. Since moving to Seattle over 35 years ago, he has studied cello with Richard Aaron, Eva Heinitz and Rajan Krishnaswami, as well as piano with Mark Salman.

He has performed as Principal Cello in several Seattle area orchestras, including [Rainier Symphony](http://www.rainiersymphony.org/index.shtml), [Northwest Symphony](https://www.northwestsymphonyorchestra.org/), [Lake Union Civic Orchestra](http://www.luco.org/), and Chaspen Chamber Orchestra. He has also played as an extra with the Boise Philharmonic and the [Yakima Symphony Orchestra](http://www.ysomusic.org/). Mr. Worswick has appeared as soloist with [Octava Chamber Orchestra]() the [Rainy City Symphony](http://www.raincitysymphony.org/), and the [Ravenna String Orchestra](http://ravennastrings.com/). He is currently Principal Cello of Octava Chamber Orchestra, and coaches and plays with the Indian Tamil band Geetanjali.

As a freelance chamber musician, Chris has performed with many area ensembles, including [Emerald City String Ensemble](http://www.camelland.net/emeraldcitystringquartet/EmeraldCityStringQuartet.htm), the [Seattle Peace Chorus](http://seattlepeacechorus.org/), Northwest Chorale, and the Gigliano Quartet. He is also a founding member of Parties d’Elegance, a chamber group dedicated to charitable performance, as well as with his long-standing cello duet, Celli Duo Nuts.

In 2009 he was fortunate to perform with indie rock greats [Pearl Jam](https://pearljam.com/), and then in 2010 to record the single Longing to Belong, with Eddie Vedder, the band’s lead singer. Chris can also be heard on the album [Tattooed by Passion](http://originarts.com/recordings/recording.php?TitleID=82568), by jazz artist [Matt Jorgensen](http://mattjorgensen.com/) and his band +451, and on the album [Sol Y Sombras](https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/meredithconnie). Most recently he performed and recorded with local artist Jeremy Shanok and The Winter Shakers.

Since retirement from a career in IT in early 2018, Chris especially enjoys teaching as part of [Wells Worswick Performance Studio](https://chrisworswick.wordpress.com/), with his wife and violin/violist Laurel Wells, and is an active accompanist, and an avid devotee of the music of Brahms, Beethoven, and Piazzola.
