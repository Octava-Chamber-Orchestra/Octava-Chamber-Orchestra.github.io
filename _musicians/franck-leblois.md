At the age of 17 Franck Leblois discovered the bassoon after having practised the trumpet and the french horn since he was 8. Three years later, he entered l’Orchestre Lyrique du Grand Théâtre de Tours where he remained for 13 years and then devoted himself exclusively to chamber music in its various forms, and to the creation and the development of the repertory of his instrument.

A graduate of the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Lyon in 1993, studying bassoon from Jean-Pierre Laroque, he also obtained in the same year a Certificate of Specialization in Chamber Music (Third cycle). In 1994, the International Chamber Music Contest of Illzach (France) decreed to him a second prize for woodwind trios. That same year he obtained the Certificate of Training for the Teaching of Bassoon (CA), which is the highest teaching diploma.

Impassioned by innovation, research, and meeting people, Franck Leblois collaborates with many artists and composers of the whole world, encouraging the creation of new works or new interpretations of existing ones. Franck Leblois has been a guest artist in many countries (USA, Romania, Poland, Mexico, Australia, Czech Republic, Morocco) as a soloist and pedagogue. In 1988, he founded the « fou de basson » organization of which he continues to be president. Every three years he organizes the “International Symposium of Pedagogy and Creative Festival for the Bassoon” which has an important impact on the international scene.

Since 2006, he has been invited as artist and professor with the Summer Festival « AMEROPA » in Prague. He also collaborates as a bassoon soloist with l’Orchestre Philharmonique du Maroc while continuing his teaching of the bassoon and chamber music at le Conservatoire National de Musique d’Angoulême where he lives.
