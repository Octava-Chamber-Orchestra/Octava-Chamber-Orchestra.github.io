Mark Wilson brings joy and technical finesse to the listener while integrating music from diverse backgrounds and different ages with a compelling story and a wry sense of humor. Performing regularly at festivals and concert series Wilson has distinguished himself as a unique voice with programs that feature his own transcriptions of the well known and the obscure. Wilson's compositions for the guitar have been appearing on stages throughout the Northwest US and Canada for over 15 years. The main medium he works in is the relatively unexplored genre of multiple guitars or Guitar Orchestra. Wilson is the conductor, composer, arranger and music director to the Guitar Orchestra of Seattle.

Wilson has taught at Whatcom Community College and Bellevue College. Wilson's CD El Sueno del Camino is the product of a series of concerts he played along the Camino de Santiago de Compostela in northern Spain. He is currently working on two projects, one on producing a Guitar orchestra CD that features compositions for 10 guitars, which was inspired by the pilgrimage to Spain, but also pilgrimages closer to home such as Chuckanut drive and the Edmund Pettis Bridge.

The Guitar orchestra CD should be available this spring and this summer Wilson will be performing works he wrote while on tour in Catalonia from this last October 2017.
