Born and raised in Grand Forks, ND, Gavin Borchert studied composition at Michigan State University and at the College-Conservatory of Music in Cincinnati with Darrell Handel and Allen Sapp. A not-entirely-unexpected failure to secure an academic post upon graduation (DMA, 1993) led him to Seattle, where he composes, writes for Seattle Weekly, and contributes CD reviews to KUOW and eMusic.com.

Works of his that have received particularly lovely performances include the overture She Stoops to Conquer (Indianapolis Symphony), Five Memos (after Calvino) (Cincinnati Symphony, Tacoma Symphony), Gjallarhorn (Seattle Youth Symphony), Aubade-canons (The Esoterics), Kermesse (Northwest Symphony), a Cello Sonata (Dave Beck), Sweet wines and wines that foam (Philharmonia Northwest), and a Piano Trio (Keith Eisenbrey, Julian Schwarz, and Matthew Weiss), in addition to any number of performances at the Seattle Composers Salon. The Octava Chamber Orchestra performed his Canon for an August afternoon in 2007.
