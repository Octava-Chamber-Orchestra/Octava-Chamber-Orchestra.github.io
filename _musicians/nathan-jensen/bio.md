Nathan Jensen attended Pacific Lutheran University as a music major. He transferred to The Evergreen State College where, under an independent contract, he studied musical composition with Timothy Brock.

Nathan is a piano tuner, organist and choir director for St. John United Lutheran Church in Seattle, accompanist for the Pacific Northwest Ballet, violinist for the Thalia Orchestra, and avid bell ringer for the set of Change Ringing bells installed 2005 at the University of Washington. He also plays theater organ for silent films at Forest Ledge in Burien.

The son of two Lutheran pastors, he showed early promise in music especially in piano and composition. He continues as an organist and choir director at St. John United Lutheran Church, but more and more his work is that of piano tuning and repair. His love for Troubadour music goes back about twenty years upon the purchase of the book, “The Music of the Troubadours” by Peter Whigham. It is from this book that four of the five melodies of this suite were taken.
