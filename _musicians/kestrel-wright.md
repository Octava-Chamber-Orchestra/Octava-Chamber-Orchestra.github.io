Kestrel Wright joined the Mid-Columbia Symphony as principal horn in the fall of 2012 and enjoys the sunny climate east of the mountains as well as giving the audience a live connection to the brilliant minds, profound historical moments, and diverse cultures preserved in music. Although Kestrel started stomping his feet and clapping his hands when he was three and playing with pitches at five it wasn't until he spied a pretty girl on the other side of the orchestra in high school that he wanted to make Music.

On the quest to make and share music Kestrel strolled through much of the United States and Chile. Along the way players of almost every instrument (including Guitar) have introduced him to their favorite pieces of chamber music and the resulting performances earned him a Bachelor's Degree in Horn performance from the University of Washington. Currently, Kestrel supports himself as a freelance horn player in Seattle playing and giving lessons while mastering both the solo and orchestral literature. If you are in Seattle you might purchase one of his publications at Capitol music or catch him playing a concerto with Octava.
