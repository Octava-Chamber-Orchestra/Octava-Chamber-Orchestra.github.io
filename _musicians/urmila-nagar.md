Born into a family of musicians, Urmila Nagar ranks as on of the foremost artists of India in the field of Kathak dance. She is the only artist of India who is outstanding dancer and reputed vocalist.

Her complete faith in and total dedication to this dance form, keenness to preserve its traditional heritage and effort to depict its devotional aspect has been highly praised. The audience is thrilled by her dazzling footwork, melodious voice and superb abhinaya. She is gifted with a golden voice which is a rarity among dancers. Aided by her command over music, she has developed a unique style of her own, presenting ,abhinaya, while singing Thumri, Bhajans etc., herself on the stage. She is hailed as a dancer with singing ghungharoos. Through her rich and varied experience she has devised performance in a systematic way beginning with prayers to almighty God, followed by items which are inter-woven in a regular sequence. This style devised by her is being imitated by present day dancers. Any form of dance without percussion support is extraordinary. It was she who visualized Kathak dance without Tabla support but without sacrificing its inherent charm. She has performed all over India in prestigious music conferences. She is a regular artist of All India Radio and has participated in number of music concerts organized by AIR and Sahitya Kala Parishad, Delhi.

She has choreographed and given music to number of choreographic dance compositions.
