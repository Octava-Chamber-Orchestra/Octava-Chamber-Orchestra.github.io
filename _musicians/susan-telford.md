Flutist Susan Telford began her musical studies on violin and piano at the age of four, briefly studied cello, and then moved on to the flute when she realized that the long, hilly walk to and from school and even life itself would be much more pleasant with a smaller instrument in hand. She received degrees from the University of Washington (BM) and Northwestern University (MM and most of a DM), and studied at several summer festivals. She was the winner of the Northwest Young Artists Competition, the Farwell Award, Bushell Concerto Competition, and numerous other competitions, as well as receiving Program Honors at Northwestern. She has been a member of the Tacoma Symphony, Elgin Symphony, Evansville Philharmonic, Chicago Chamber Orchestra, and several chamber groups, as well as a substitute with the Seattle Symphony, Seattle Opera, Pacific Northwest Ballet, and Grant Park Symphony, among others.

As a member of the chamber ensemble Quake Susan recently performed at the Pacific Rim Music Festival in California, the CrossSound Festival in Alaska, and the Music Biennale Zagreb, and as a studio musician she has performed on countless movie soundtracks and various other projects. In addition to her private flute students, she has served on the faculties of several institutions, including the University of Evansville, Midsummer Musical Retreat, and Southern Illinois Music Festival. When not playing or teaching the flute, Susan can be found up to her knees in toys with her children Max and Lena.
