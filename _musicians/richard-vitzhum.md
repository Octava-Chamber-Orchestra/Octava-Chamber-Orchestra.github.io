Richard Vitzhum is classically trained as a conductor, violinist, violist, and music theorist at New York City’s Mannes College of Music. Most of his early professional career was in the world of Broadway, in particular with national tours as solo violinist and conductor for Fiddler on the Roof, The King and I, and Carousel. More recently, he has played viola in the Everett Philharmonic as well as writing its program notes. He has appeared as a string player with the Octava Chamber Orchestra of Lynnwood, the Saratoga Orchestra of Whidbey Island, the (sadly departed) Volunteer Park Conservatory Orchestra of Seattle, and the Sno-King Chorale, among others. He has guest conducted for the Northwest Wind Symphony of Centralia. He regularly performs, arranges, composes, and conducts for the musical programs of Mukilteo Presbyterian Church. He also performs on mandolin, fiddle, and back-up vocals with the gospel band Stained Glass Bluegrass.

Richard was featured in a front-page article in the Mukilteo Beacon about his life as “banker by day and composer by night.” Compositions that have been performed locally include Seattle’s Greed (short musical,) Perchance to Dream (fantasy for bassoon and orchestra,) You Are Not Alone (song for baritone and orchestra,) and Time and Tide (tone poem for chamber orchestra.) Despite his background as a string player, several of his pieces feature brass, including the Quintet In Natura, Three Inventions for trumpet and tuba, and the Petite Suite for seven trumpeters.
