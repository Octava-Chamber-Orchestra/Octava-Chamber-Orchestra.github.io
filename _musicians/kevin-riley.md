Kevin Riley began his musical career as with most musicians, playing the recorder. This led to the Trumpet and then Trombone.

At the age of 15 he joined the Army as a Trombone player, quickly rising through the playing ranks of the Junior Army Service and then onto the Royal Military School of Music, Kneller Hall, in London, where he studied under Mr. William Teskey and Mr. Dennis Bayton.

Along with playing the Trombone he acquired a thirst for knowledge of other wind and brass instruments and was frequently seen mixing with all sorts of musicians, both in and out of bars! In 1973, he joined Band of the The Queen’s Royal Irish Hussars and was their Solo Trombone player for nine years. It was here that he first started to arrange and compose, having his first piece performed on national German Radio; it was an arrangement of the ‘Theme from The Godfather’.

He left the Army in 1981, seeking musical work wherever he could find it, and frequently depped in various theatre pits throughout the English south coast. The list of his ensemble membership includes big bands, jazz bands, brass ensembles, orchestras, German bands and recorder consorts!

Presently he is teaching at Thorngrove School in Berkshire and for the Berkshire Maestro's in Newbury, where he works with the trumpet ensemble, Mr Snow's Trumpets, the Clifton Wind Band and 4+2, a Saxophone and Trombone ensemble. He is also the Musical Director of The Allegro Wind Band and The Andover Light Orchestra.
