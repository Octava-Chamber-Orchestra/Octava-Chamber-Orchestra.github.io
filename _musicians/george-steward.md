After earning trumpet performance degrees at Wheaton Conservatory and Yale School of Music, he is pleased to be back in the Northwest, living in Lynnwood with his wife Diane, three sons, and a daughter. He is principal trumpet with Everett Philharmonic, Cascade Symphony, and Octava Chamber Orchestra, and is a memeber of Lake Washington Symphony. George is a member of the Brass Reflections quintet and Evergreen Brass Quintet. He has performed with the Seattle Symphony, Seattle Opera, Bellevue Philharmonic, Tacoma Symphony, Yakima Symphony, Orchestra Seattle, Lake Union Chamber Orchestra, and many other groups throughout the Northwest and across the country.

Later this season he will be soloist with Mukilteo Community Orchestra and Philharmonia Northwest.

According to his kids, George has a horrible sense of humor. They claim puns are not their favorite. We're pretty sure they laugh in secret, though.
