# A YAML timestamp just before the desired active concert.
# Note the value must include a time as just a date will cause type errors.
# This time isn't displayed anywhere on the site, it's just used to select the active concert.
# The active concert will appear as a banner in the header and on the home page.
# Inputting the date of the desired concert but leaving time at 00:00:00 works great.
