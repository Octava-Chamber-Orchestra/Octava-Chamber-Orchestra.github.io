<strong style="font-size:1.3em;">The Octava Chamber Orchestra</strong> is an ensemble of the Northwest's finest musicians who have come together solely to provide first rate performances of great music.

We play the music of the masters such as Bach, Corelli, Vivaldi, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Grieg, Debussy, etc. and also premiere new music by 21st century composers of a variety of genres.

**The Octava Chamber Orchestra** was originally formed by Maestro Johan Louwersheimer and Concertmaster Matthew Weiss in 1991 after they met as students at the University of Washington School of Music. Octava put on a number of great performances in the USA and Canada and disbanded when Johan completed his studies at the UW and returned to his home in Abbotsford Canada. We reformed in the summer of 2007 and have been going strong ever since.

**The Octava Chamber Orchestra** is a non-profit corporation in the State of Washington, a tax exempt organization under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and a 509(a)(2) public charity.
